 * Christmas Candle Timer
 * Jack Christensen
 * v1.1 09Oct2011
 * v1.2 04Dec2011 Added sunrise and sunset calculation, and ability
 *      for a schedule to turn the lamps on or off at sunrise or
 *      sunset, plus or minus an offset.
 *
 * The calculated sunrise and sunset do not currently take DST into
 * account, standard time is always assumed. This is OK because the
 * candles will only be used during the holidays, i.e. standard time,
 * but for other uses this should be added.
